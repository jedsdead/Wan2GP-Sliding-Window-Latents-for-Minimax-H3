"""Extended audio context on Ref2VA: does anything land on anything else?

test_audio_context.py does this for FL2VA.  Ref2VA differs in a way that matters
here: build_ref2va_packed_sequence walks a time cursor across the reference
tokens first, from float(text_len) up to time_cursor, and only then places the
history block at history_time = time_cursor and the target at
time_cursor + _reference_t_span(history_frames).  So the span below the history
is occupied rather than vacant, and "move everything except the audio history
later by extra" walks the references into the gap it just opened.

This models the builder's time axis directly from packing.py and checks
occupancy, rather than checking that the code does what it says.  Three layouts
are compared:

  native      extra = 0, nothing moved
  naive       extra > 0, everything from text_len moved (the 1.2.1 behaviour,
              which is why Ref2VA was refused outright)
  corrected   extra > 0, the reference span held still

The naive layout must show a collision and the corrected one must not, since a
test that passes for both would not be testing anything.
