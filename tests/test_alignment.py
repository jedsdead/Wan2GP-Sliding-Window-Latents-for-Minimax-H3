"""Tests for the join-alignment search.

Numpy only - no Wan2GP, no torch, no GPU. `_check_alignment` is reimplemented
here against the same constants, because the real one takes torch tensors and
the logic under test is the search, not the tensor plumbing.

THE FAILURE BEING GUARDED
-------------------------
The next window hands back `continuation[:, -overlap:-1]`, so its last frame is
the previous window's decoded frame -2. If the cached latents end somewhere
else, the carried block gets placed as though it ended at the join, and the
model is handed footage from *after* the join as though it came before - and
renders it again. That is a repeated shot, not a stutter.

The old check compared one fingerprint at one offset against a 3% tolerance.
The tests below show why that cannot work: on a slow shot, frames several
apart differ by well under 3%, so a displaced tail passes and nothing reports
it. Searching the run finds where the join actually sits and reports the skew.
